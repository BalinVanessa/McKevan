# Fin Friends - Human Computer Interaction Final Project
This is a interface prototype for human computer interaction glass designed around the idea of how we can use technology to promote human interaction. Based on several rounds of research and interviews we designed an prototype interface to encourage the user to set and achieve their social goals.
